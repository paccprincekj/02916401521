first 
for implementing question 1 we will 
Utilize the APIs of five e-commerce companies to retrieve product data.
Create a GET REST API endpoint "/categories/:categoryname/products" to showcase the top 'n' products within a specified category and price range.
Allow users to specify 'n' as a query parameter and implement pagination if 'n' exceeds 10.
Generate a custom unique identifier for each product in the response.
Allow users to pass additional query parameters to sort results based on rating, price, company, or discount in ascending or descending order.
Implement a GET REST API endpoint "/categories/:categoryname/products/:productid" to retrieve details of a specific product matching the provided ID.
Ensure timely, performance, and accurate responses to users while minimizing costs associated with API calls to the Test Server.
Accommodate changes in sorting order or product data made by the e-commerce companies without prior notice.
